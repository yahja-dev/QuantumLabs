#Quantum Computing Lab
##Dependencies
###Install `python 3.8.6`
download and install from:
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-386/

###Install Python Package Manager `pip`
https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/

###Install project requirements in `requirements.txt`
navigate to the project root folder and run:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

##Project Structure
* There are four directories in the project each corresponding to a lab: `GroversAlgorithm`, `QuantumPhaseEstimation`, `QuantumTeleportation`, and `ShorsAlgorithm`

* Within each directory, there are two python file `methods.py` and another python file representing the main function named after the algorithm implemented
* Within each directory, there is an `illustrations` directory in which the program saves the circuits' representations and graphs

##Test the Labs
In order to test a lab:
* Navigate to its folder. For example, `GroversAlgorithm`
* Open the main file (the one besides `methods.py`). For instance, `grover.py`
* Run the main file
* Check `illustrations` for circuit representation and graphs
